SECTION 9. No Loopholes; Interpretation.
  9.1 No Evasion. You may not exploit any ambiguity or omission in the wording of this License to defeat its intent, including to enable uses prohibited by Section 4(d) or to circumvent the copyleft requirement in Section 4(c).
  9.2 Headings; Construction. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. This License shall be interpreted to give effect to its plain meaning and stated intent.
